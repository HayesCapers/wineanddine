### Restaurant Search

	The Restaurants page will allow users to search for restaurants in their area by a basic location search or view the top-rated restaurants in their area. A random button also exists and allows registered users to have a random restaurant in the area of their stored address. Each return will show the address and cuisine type of the restaurant. 

### Recipe Search

	The recipes page allows users to search for recipes randomly or through a form that offers a series of parameters to narrow search results. Search parameters include: allowing ingredients, excluding ingredients, cuisine, diet, and allergies. Both searches return five results populating five pages generated beneath the original search area. Users have the ability to save recipes that they like. Saved recipes are accessible through the account page.

### Beverage Search

	The beverages page offers users the ability to search for wine suggestions based on color, variety, and price range. Users can also sort search results in ascending or descending order of price. Each search returns twenty wine suggestions with three food pairing suggestions per wine. In addition to searching for wines the user can search for food pairings to go with a wine they already have.
